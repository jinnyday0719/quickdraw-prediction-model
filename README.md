*The above GIF demonstrates how the QuickDraw model performs in action.*

This project uses the Google Quick, Draw! dataset to classify simple sketches using a ResNet-based deep learning model. The trained model has been converted to TensorFlow.js for web deployment, enabling users to test predictions through a simple web interface.
